# ConvexifyingVerification

This code is used to verify Proposition 3 in our paper "New Insights on One-Sided Lipschitz and Quadratically Inner-Bounded Nonlinear Dynamic Systems"

We use the Global Optimization Toolbox to solve a nonconvex problem. After comparing the solutions from Global Optimation and our convexified problem in our paper, it can be concluded that our convexifying produce is correct.
